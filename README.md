# Go Learning  

Welcome to my **Go Learning** repository! ðŸš€  

This is my personal space where I share code snippets, examples, and projects as I learn the **Go programming language**. The repository serves as a log of my progress, experiments, and solutions to exercises I encounter along the way.

## About  

This repository isn't meant to be a polished product or professional project. It's more like a sandbox for my Go learning journey.  
Here, you can find:  
- Code snippets from tutorials and exercises.  
- Solutions to problems I solve while studying.  
- Notes and experiments as I explore Go's features.

## Topics Covered  

Here are some of the areas I'm working on (and planning to explore):  
1. Basics: Variables, loops, functions, and conditionals.  
2. Data Structures: Arrays, slices, maps, and structs.  
3. Concurrency: Goroutines, channels, and synchronization.  
4. File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.  
5. HTTP: Making requests and handling responses.  
6. Error Handling and Panic/Recover.

## How to Use  

Feel free to browse through the code to:  
- See how I approach different problems.  
- Explore Go-specific syntax and features.  
- Track my learning progress!

## Why This Repository Exists  

I created this repository to:  
1. **Document my progress** as I learn Go.  
2. **Keep track of solutions** to exercises and projects.  
3. **Reflect on my growth** by revisiting earlier code.
